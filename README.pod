=head1 NAME

Hadoop::HiveCLI - Run hive CLI processes with a given configuration

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $hive = Cmd::HiveRunner->new(
    user => 'sscaffid',
    conf => { foo => 'bar' }
  );

  # confs are merged, with conf in run getting precedence.
  my $job = $hive->run(
    conf  => { 'mapred.job.queue.name' => 'default' },
    query => q{select * from t_location LIMIT 5},
  );

  # if you want to run things synchronously, just do this.
  $job->wait;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a class used to run queries via the Hive CLI, as a specific user and setting
things like which mapreduce job queue to use.

Calling C<new> sets up an object with whatever you want your defaults to be, and makes
sure the program can find your hive and sudo commands. (sudo is necessary to run jobs
as a different user).

Then, you can kick off hive processes by calling C<run> with a query (in HQL), and
as that process runs in the background, you can check on the progress, and get other
potentially useful info about it.
